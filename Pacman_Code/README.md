# Pacman Project

The Pacman project is to create an AI-based Pacman agent that could navigate via a maze to collect food from a specified location. Implemented various search algorithms â€“ depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A*, while maintaining admissibility and consistency. Implemented minmax and expectimax search algorithms to optimize routes against ghost-ridden area.

The codes that we wrote are in 2 files - search.py and searchAgents.py, where the 4 search algorithms (DFS, BFS, uniform cost, A*) are implemented in search.py.
