# CS_Projects
This repository contains two of my projects: Gitlet and Pacman. 

The Gitlet project is to create a version-control system mimicking basic features in a popular system - Git using Java standard library.
The details of this Gitlet project: https://cs61bl.org/su22/projects/gitlet/ .
The code are inside Gitlet_Project -> proj2 -> gitlet. The test files are inside Gitlet Project-> proj2 -> test_files.  

For the Pacman...
