# Projects
This repository contains two of my class projects - Gitlet and Pacman, and one of my summer intern project - Longzhitou_Data_Mining_Intern.

The summer internship Longzhitou data mining project is aimed to increase the marketing campaign efficiency of a balanced fund through building machine learning models to identify target customers with high probability of response (>90%). The file contains a project report pdf and a PowerPoint presentation of the project road maps. 



The Gitlet project is to create a version-control system mimicking basic features in a popular system - Git using Java standard library.

The code are inside Gitlet_Project -> proj2 -> gitlet. The test files are inside Gitlet Project-> proj2 -> test_files.  

The Pacman project is to create an AI-based Pacman agent that could navigate via a maze to collect food from a specified location.
